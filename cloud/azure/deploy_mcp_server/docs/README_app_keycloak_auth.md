## Quick setup

Follow instructions in README for ["Deploy to Azure with Keycloak"](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-mcp-demos?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy-to-azure-with-keycloak-authentication):

User: admin

```bash
azd auth login
azd env set MCP_AUTH_PROVIDER keycloak
azd env set KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD "YourSecurePassword123"
azd up
```

## Deploy to Azure with Keycloak authentication

This project supports deploying with OAuth 2.0 authentication using Keycloak as the identity provider, implementing the [MCP OAuth specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

### What gets deployed

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Keycloak Container App** | Keycloak 26.0 with pre-configured realm |
| **HTTP Route Configuration** | Rule-based routing: `/auth/*` → Keycloak, `/*` → MCP Server |
| **OAuth-protected MCP Server** | FastMCP with JWT validation against Keycloak's JWKS endpoint |

### Deployment steps

1. Enable Keycloak authentication:

   ```bash
   azd env set MCP_AUTH_PROVIDER keycloak
   ```

2. Set the Keycloak admin password (required):

   ```bash
   azd env set KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD "YourSecurePassword123!"
   ```

3. Optionally customize the realm name (default: `mcp`):

   ```bash
   azd env set KEYCLOAK_REALM_NAME "mcp"
   ```

4. Deploy to Azure:

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

   This will create the Azure Container Apps environment, deploy Keycloak with the pre-configured realm, deploy the MCP server with OAuth validation, and configure HTTP route-based routing.

5. Verify deployment by checking the outputs:

   ```bash
   azd env get-value MCP_SERVER_URL
   azd env get-value KEYCLOAK_DIRECT_URL
   azd env get-value KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CONSOLE
   ```

6. Visit the Keycloak admin console to verify the realm is configured:

   ```text
   https://<your-mcproutes-url>/auth/admin
   ```

   Login with `admin` and your configured password.


### Use Keycloak OAuth MCP server with GitHub Copilot

The Keycloak deployment supports Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), which allows VS Code to automatically register as an OAuth client. VS Code redirect URIs are pre-configured in the Keycloak realm.

To use the deployed MCP server with GitHub Copilot Chat:

1. To avoid conflicts, stop the MCP servers from `mcp.json` and disable the expense MCP servers in GitHub Copilot Chat tools.
2. Select "MCP: Add Server" from the VS Code Command Palette
3. Select "HTTP" as the server type
4. Enter the URL of the MCP server from `azd env get-value MCP_SERVER_URL`
5. You should see a Keycloak authentication screen open in your browser. Select "Allow access":

   ![Keycloak allow access screen](screenshots/kc-allow-1.jpg)

6. Sign in with a Keycloak user (e.g., `testuser` / `testpass` for the pre-configured demo user):

   ![Keycloak sign-in screen](screenshots/kc-signin-2.jpg)

7. After authentication, the browser will redirect back to VS Code:

   ![VS Code redirect after Keycloak sign-in](screenshots/kc-redirect-3.jpg)

8. Enable the MCP server in GitHub Copilot Chat tools:

   ![Select MCP tools in GitHub Copilot](screenshots/kc-select-tools-4.jpg)

9. Test it with an expense tracking query:

   ```text
   Log expense for 75 dollars of office supplies on my visa last Friday
   ```

   ![Example GitHub Copilot Chat with Keycloak auth](screenshots/kc-chat-5.jpg)

10. Verify the expense was added by checking the Cosmos DB `user-expenses` container in the Azure Portal or by asking GitHub Copilot Chat:

    ```text
    Show me my expenses from last week
    ```

### Known limitations (demo trade-offs)

| Item | Current | Production Recommendation | Why |
|------|---------|---------------------------|-----|
| Keycloak mode | `start-dev` | `start` with proper config | Dev mode has relaxed security defaults |
| Database | H2 in-memory | PostgreSQL | H2 doesn't persist data across restarts |
| Replicas | 1 (due to H2) | Multiple with shared DB | H2 is in-memory, can't share state |
| Keycloak access | Public (direct URL) | Internal only via routes | Route URL isn't known until after deployment |
| DCR | Open (anonymous) | Require initial access token | Any client can register without auth |

> **Note:** Keycloak must be publicly accessible because its URL is dynamically generated by Azure. Token issuer validation requires a known URL, but the mcproutes URL isn't available until after deployment. Using a custom domain would fix this.

## Deploy to Azure with Entra OAuth Proxy

This project supports deploying with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication using FastMCP's built-in Azure OAuth proxy. This is an alternative to Keycloak that uses Microsoft Entra with your Azure tenant for identity management.

### What gets deployed with Entra OAuth

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Microsoft Entra App Registration** | Created automatically during provisioning with redirect URIs for local development, VS Code, and production |
| **OAuth-protected MCP Server** | FastMCP with AzureProvider for OAuth authentication |
| **CosmosDB OAuth Client Storage** | Persists OAuth client registrations across server restarts |

### Deployment steps for Entra OAuth

1. Enable Entra OAuth proxy:

   ```bash
   azd env set MCP_AUTH_PROVIDER entra_proxy
   ```

2. Set your tenant ID so that the App Registration is created in the correct tenant:

   ```bash
   azd env set AZURE_TENANT_ID "<your-tenant-id>"
   ```

3. Deploy to Azure:

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

   During deployment:
   - **Preprovision hook**: Creates a Microsoft Entra App Registration with a client secret, and stores the credentials in azd environment variables
   - **Postprovision hook**: Updates the App Registration with the deployed server URL as an additional redirect URI

4. Verify deployment by checking the outputs:

   ```bash
   azd env get-value MCP_SERVER_URL
   azd env get-value ENTRA_PROXY_AZURE_CLIENT_ID
   ```

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are automatically set by the deployment hooks:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ENTRA_PROXY_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | The App Registration's client ID |
| `ENTRA_PROXY_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | The App Registration's client secret |

These are then written to `.env` by the postprovision hook for local development.

### Testing the Entra OAuth server locally

After deployment, you can test locally with OAuth enabled:

```bash
# Run the MCP server
cd servers && uvicorn auth_mcp:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The server will use the Entra App Registration for OAuth and CosmosDB for client storage.

### Use Entra OAuth MCP server with GitHub Copilot

The Entra App Registration includes these redirect URIs for VS Code:

- `https://vscode.dev/redirect` (VS Code web)
- `http://127.0.0.1:{33418-33427}` (VS Code desktop local auth helper, 10 ports)

To use the deployed MCP server with GitHub Copilot Chat:

1. To avoid conflicts, stop the MCP servers from `mcp.json` and disable the expense MCP servers in GitHub Copilot Chat tools.
2. Select "MCP: Add Server" from the VS Code Command Palette
3. Select "HTTP" as the server type
4. Enter the URL of the MCP server, either from `MCP_SERVER_URL` environment variable or `http://localhost:8000/mcp` if running locally.
5. If you get an error about "Client ID not found", open the Command Palette, run **"Authentication: Remove Dynamic Authentication Providers"**, and select the MCP server URL. This clears any cached OAuth tokens and forces a fresh authentication flow. Then restart the server to prompt the OAuth flow again.
6. You should see a FastMCP authentication screen open in your browser. Select "Allow access":

   ![FastMCP authentication screen](readme_appaccess.png)

7. After granting access, the browser will redirect to a VS Code "Sign-in successful!" page and then bring focus back to VS Code.

   ![VS Code sign-in successful page](readme_signedin.png)

8. Enable the MCP server in GitHub Copilot Chat tools and test it with an expense tracking query:

   ```text
   Log expense for 75 dollars of office supplies on my visa last Friday
   ```

9. Verify the expense was added by checking the Cosmos DB `user-expenses` container in the Azure Portal.
